<h2> Institute Web Administrator and<br/>SLC Web & System Administrator Team </h2>

The Tech Team started in 2021 as the group that built the first website for the Clubs Council (CC). Since then, we’ve grown into a team that supports all major clubs, councils, and student groups on campus with technical help and web management.

Today, we not only build websites but also help maintain them, serving as web administrators for these groups. We also work with the institute’s IT office to help manage systems and servers, making sure everything runs smoothly.

<!-- Description of the team goes here. -->
<!-- The Student life Council Tech Team is a team of student software
developers, that also play the role as CC-Tech Team and student Webadmins.
We help various comittee's and student bodies build and maintain websites
and provide support with server infrastructure.
