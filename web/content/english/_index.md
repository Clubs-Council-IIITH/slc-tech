<h2> Institute Web Administrator and<br/>SLC Web & System Administrator Team </h2>

The Tech Team started in 2021 as the group that built the first website for the Clubs Council (CC). Since the release of Version 1 in 2022, we've grown into a dedicated technical powerhouse serving all clubs and student bodies across the institution.

#### Who We Are
We're a passionate team that initially built the first website for the Clubs Council (CC). Since then, we've evolved into a comprehensive technical support team that helps all major clubs, councils, and student groups on campus with web management and technical assistance.

#### What We Do
Our work spans a wide range of technical services, including:

- Developing and maintaining websites for the Clubs Council and various student bodies, such as NSS, Cultural Council, CLC, etc.
- Providing systems and server support to ensure the smooth functioning of student activities and operations.
- Collaborating with the institute's IT department to maintain infrastructure and resolve technical challenges.

Today, we not only build websites but also help maintain them, serving as web administrators for these groups. We also work with the instituteâ€™s IT office to help manage systems and servers, making sure everything runs smoothly.

With each project, we aim to uphold our core values of innovation, reliability, and teamwork. Together, we're shaping the future of our institution's digital landscape.
